## 🛸 Greetings, fellow starfarers! 🛸

I'm Utsah, a pre-final yearite at IITR, currently navigating the digital cosmos, armed with Django and a touch of JS.

🔭 **Currently working on:** Expanding my skills in web development & REST API, hoping to build robust backends. 

🌱 **Currently learning:** Django framework, the ins and outs of REST APIs, and diving deeper into the world of data science.

👯 **Looking to collaborate on:** Open-source projects that involve Django, React or full-stack development. Particularly interested in impactful applications for education, social networking, or gym management (been there, built that! 💪).

🤔 **Looking for help with:** Understanding the nuances of hosting on cloud (AWS/Docker) ☁️ and aiming for stars ✨ in the art of database management (PostgreSQL).

📫 **How to reach me:** You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/utsah470/) or ping me on [Twitter](https://x.com/utsah470). Can connect on [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/utsah470/) as well. 😉

⚡ **Fun fact:** I'm convinced that the best code is written while listening to Diljeet's beats and sipping on Moon-Child Era tea.
